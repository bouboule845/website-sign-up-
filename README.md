In this project, you will write a program that prompts a user to sign up for a website. The user must come up with a username and password, then log in using the username and password.

There are requirements for both the username and password. If either one doesnâ€™t meet the requirements, print an appropriate error message and ask the username for a new username and password.

If they are both valid, store them as variables. Then ask the user to log in using the username and password they chose.
